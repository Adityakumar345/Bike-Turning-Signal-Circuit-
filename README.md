. The 555 timer placed in the circuit above is used for the generation of pulse signals of varying width. The pulse signals produced by the 555 timer used herein form the output of the timer. These signals have a certain width that can easily be varied. When integrated into a bike signal system, these signals are one of the causes of the blinking effect.
